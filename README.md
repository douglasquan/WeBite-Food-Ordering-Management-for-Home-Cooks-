# Why We built this App

WeBite is a food ordering app designed to bridge the gap between home cooks and friends.The app was developed to streamline order management and enhance the user experience, transcending the limitations of traditional communication and management methods. 

Webite revolutionizes this process by offering a centralized platform where chefs can manage menus, take orders, and process payments seamlessly. Its tailored interface is designed specifically for culinary commerce, enabling better organization, real-time updates, and a more engaging user experience compared to the ad-hoc systems previously used.
